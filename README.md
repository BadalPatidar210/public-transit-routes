To use this webapp, when you visit the home page there is a list of routes in left side and in the right side corrosponding polyline shown in graph for the path containing waypoints or stops.

Also , you can create routes by clicking the add route button.
While creating new routes there is an option of creating stops as well.

For creating stops you need to have city name and its latitude and longitude also.
As soon as you creates stops, you will be redirected to the create route page where you can see the newly created stop is present in dropdown.

Once you create route you will be redirected to the list view page.

While you were at view routes page you can also edit and delete the routes.

For Editing any route you will be redirected to another page where all the values were prefilled and you can change values you want.
